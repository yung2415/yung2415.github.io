## Welcome to My Website😁

I leave my previous job to pursue study and graduated from Coventry University in 2021. During the break, I find myself interested in computer science and self-studied to obtain Responsive Web Design Certificate from freeCodecamp. From July to September, I joined the course held by KCRA Community Education Enhancement Center and erb for Foundation Certificate in Junior Webpage Designer Training to enhance my knowledge in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Animate cc and dreamweaver. I then continue my study on Javascipt ,SQL and Reactjs.

## Html and CSS projects🥳

Studied at FreeCodeCamp and Erb course, I made serveral webpages by css and html and uploaded them to code.pen.io. The websites are build with basic tag and table, image, form, imbeded youtube, input tag.
With the help of css, most of them are responsive and able show smoothly on different screens. Css effect like hover, viewpoint setting are added.
Beside, I also set up a personal portfolio as seen powered by github page.
Below are Survey Form and Tribute pageI created.
