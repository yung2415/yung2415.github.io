## Welcome to My Website

I leave my previous job to pursue study and graduated from Coventry University in 2021. During the break, I find myself interested in computer science and self-studied to obtain Responsive Web Design Certificate from freeCodecamp. From July to September, I joined the course held by KCRA Community Education Enhancement Center and erb for Foundation Certificate in Junior Webpage Designer Training to enhance my knowledge in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Animate cc and dreamweaver. I then continue my study on Javascipt ,SQL and Reactjs.
